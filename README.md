[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/828986409171157001/embed.png?style=banner2)](https://discord.gg/zfG25VS5Pr)

This is a bot made specifically for the Rouxl's Lab server, it is designed to function like Zira and most reaction-role bots but with buttons.

## Features

+ Customizeable status
+ Selection of whitelisted servers
+ Context menus
+ Hidden messages for roles

## Can I self host it?

Probably not. Maybe. Self-hosting is not supported and the bot is private, so please don't ask for access as the bot was only designed for 1 server.

## Can I have the bot?

Definitely not, unless I think your server has value or will have proper usage for it, then sure go for it and ask! Message me on Discord: Rouxl#0001
